Make the skill tree similar to patents in offworld trading company, they can patent an idea so that only they can

As its single player, the skill tree can be only for the actual player rather than AI, this makes it so you could
have something like SkillTree['ID']:=SkillTree['ID']+1 as they climb up the 'tree'. This also means that the
player will always win the game from unlimited time so a time limit needs to be in place as well as AI to be
stronger than the player in the beginning.
